title: Heroku Demo | Deploying a Twitter Bot Capstone Project
---

In mid-2016 I built at Twitter bot, @findmyatm. Through that process I learned how to deploy a web-based application running continuously on a remote server via Heroku. I wanted to share that knowledge, so I helped a few keen friends with the basics. I created [this repository](https://github.com/ByronAllen/heroku_demo) to help demostrate the fundamentals for deploying a program on Heroku using a simple Twitter bot. I hope it will also help anyone looking to quickly learn how to remotely deploy a program.
