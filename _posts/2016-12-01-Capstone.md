title: Capstone Project | Filling the Land Conversion Gap with Machine Learning
---

Earlier in 2016, I worked on a project examining whether or not the ethanol industry in the U.S. was a driving factor in land conversion (e.g. the conversion of wild land to agricultural land). One of the key hurdles was a lack of publically available data on land conversion. There was [only one year on the record](https://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Wildlife/2013/9-18-13-USDA-Data-Grasslands-Forests-Being-Converted-to-Cropland-at-Alarming-Rates.aspx)! 

So, I endeavored to see how I could apply newly learned skills in machine learning to satellite images and create a method to generate a land conversion record. This became my capstone project for General Assembly's 12-week Data Science Immersive course.
