##### Byron Allen, Data Scientist with Interest in Geospatial
I'm a data scientist who graduated from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course in November 2016. Previously, I worked in marketing communications. Hands-on experience with data-driven insights and reports became the catalyst to my current journey. In April 2016, I decided to fully commit myself to re-skilling.

Iâ€™m excited by the results that machine learning and predictive analysis can deliver, and how data- driven decision-making can help shape a better future. That's why I chose 'Filling the Land Conversion Gap with Machine Learning' as my capstone project for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course.
